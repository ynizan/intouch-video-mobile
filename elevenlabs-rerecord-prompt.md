# ElevenLabs Re-Record Prompt

Only **3 voice overs** changed. The rest remain identical to the current recordings.

## S2 -- Calendar (s2.mp3)

**OLD:**
> I was raising a seed round. Every week I had a few meetings -- advisors, friends, customers. But they never led to investor intros.

**NEW:**
> I was raising my first round of funding. Every week I had a few meetings -- advisors, friends, customers. But they never led to investor intros.

**Direction:** Same reflective, slightly frustrated tone. The phrase "my first round of funding" should feel personal and vulnerable -- emphasize "my" lightly. Pace unchanged.

## S6 -- Network Scan (s6.mp3)

**OLD:**
> I was meeting with Jake -- a founder with deep VC connections. Before the meeting, InTouch scanned his network. Found who he could reach, and who could connect me up -- to investors I couldn't access on my own.

**NEW:**
> I was meeting with Jake -- a founder with deep venture capital connections. Before the meeting, InTouch scanned his network. Found who he could reach, and who could connect me up -- to investors I couldn't access on my own.

**Direction:** Same measured, story-telling tone. "venture capital" replaces "VC" -- say it naturally, not overly formal. Two extra syllables; keep the same overall pacing and breath placement.

## S8 -- Momentum Building (s8.mp3)

**OLD:**
> Each meeting started generating more intros -- to investors, serial founders, and top advisors. Access was opening up.

**NEW:**
> Each meeting started generating more intros -- to investors, repeat founders, and top advisors. Access was opening up.

**Direction:** Same rising, optimistic energy. "repeat founders" should sound casual and natural -- same emphasis pattern as the original "serial founders." No other pacing changes.
